## For identifying putative chromothriptic regions: chromothripsis()
Implements three of the tests for chromothripsis from [Korbel & Campbell (2013)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413002122). 
Tests for departure from exponentially distributed distances between breakpoints, equal proportion of HH, HT, TH and TT fusions partners, and random choice of fusion partners.
